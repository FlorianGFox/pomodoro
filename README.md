# Flutter MacOS Pomodoro

A complete pomodoro app for MacOS built in Flutter.

Contains example code for basic window management, 
shortcut and menu bar customization, notifications, storage 
and playback.

A lot of the plugins used in this project are experimental.

## Custom Plugins

I had to build my own plugins for getting the miniaturization status
of the window and bringing the window to the front of the screen, 
(i.e, focusing on the window). Check it out!
